Also please do NOT look at my last quarter), and some truly good models. Although we are most likely not getting AGI, as seemingly every major AI company is converging on creating the best video slop website that money can buy, which is totally what would be reasonable to do when you are close to obtaining computer god. But that is besides the point, because models have gotten truly good. At the time of writing this, the GPT-5 family, although slooooow, is fairly nice. As is Sonnet 4.5, which also boasts great quality. But it is kind of pricey, unlike DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp, which is similar to V3.1-Terminus, but much cheaper.
<em>EDIT: In the time between writing this paragraph and finishing the post, new Gemini, DeepSeek, and Claude models have come out. So. Yeah.</em></p><span><a href=https://martnquesada.github.io/blog/2026/01/cascading-pipelines-with-dspy-are-kind-of-good/>Read more...</a></span></p></article><article class=blog-post-summary><h3 class=blog-post-title><a href=https://martnquesada.github.io/blog/2024/10/an-unhelpful-summary-of-pycones-2024/>An unhelpful summary of PyConES 2024</a></h3><p class=blog-post-info>Posted: <time>2024-10-09</time>

In the process, I wanted to <em>really</em> understand the implementation of some commonly used
tokenizers. Fun, I know.</p><h3 id=moses-tokenizer>Moses Tokenizer</h3><p><em>Webpage <a href=http://www2.statmt.org/>http://www2.statmt.org/</a> and the implementation that I&rsquo;ll talk about
<a href=https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder/blob/master/scripts/tokenizer/tokenizer.perl>tokenizer.perl</a>.</em></p><p>If you already know Moses, you know. Silent nod. For everyone else, Moses is an NLP framework written in Perl, focused on statistical machine translation.
It is super easy to install anywhere and everyone loves it because of it.
Aside from language models and statistical machine translation utilities, it also includes tools to clean text, namely punctuation normalization, tokenization and cleaning corpora by limiting sentence length.
From these I am concerned with the normalize-punctuation script and the tokenizer itself, because I don&rsquo;t remember ever <strong>not</strong> using punctuation normalization along with the tokenizer.</p><span><a href=https://martnquesada.github.io/blog/2023/05/taking-a-look-at-some-tokenizers/>Read more...</a></span></p></article><article class=blog-post-summary><h3 class=blog-post-title><a href=https://martnquesada.github.io/blog/2022/11/an-unhelpful-summary-of-amta-2022/>An unhelpful summary of AMTA 2022</a></h3><p class=blog-post-info>Posted: <time>2022-11-06</time>
